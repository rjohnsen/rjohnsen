# Hei, terve, hello, konnichiwa! 

I am Roger Johnsen - a norwegian Threat Hunter and Programmer/Developer. My interest ranges from coding in Python, Golang and Rust, to security, CTF and of course, Threat Hunting! 
Somehow I focus on threat hunting by a combination of detection engineering, statistics and development - in way you can say I an into Threatection Huntineering!

## The section about Corgis

I am a devout Corgi lover. Whenever I see fit, I merge in Corgi references. Deal with it or get a Cardigan ðŸ¤£
