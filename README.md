# Hei, terve, hello, konnichiwa! 

I am Roger Johnsen - a norwegian Threat Hunter and Programmer/Developer. My interest ranges from coding in Python, Golang and Rust, security, CTF and of course, Threeat Hunting! 

## The section about Corgis

I am a devout Corgi lover. Whenever I see fit, I merge in Corgi references. Deal with it ðŸ¤£
